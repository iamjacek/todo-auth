# 👨🏻‍💻 Todo with authentication

<br>

## Project Overview 🎉

Remake of my first app. Users can register and keep their notes private.
Register to create an account. Add some to-dos. Your to-dos will be saved for you from now you can log in and check them later!

## Some features:
- press enter to add list
- click on to-do item to mark as done
- delete single item, all list or just clear all items within a list
- all todos are being saved on a server you can log out and back later
